# Magic-8-Ball
The program answers a user's yes or no question with a possibility of 10 responses.
I hope to impement a feature that doesn't allow the same response back to back in the future.

The user is prompted to type in a yes or no question that must end with a question mark. If there is no question mark, the program will ask for the user to add a questionmark at the end of their question
The program will spit out 1 out of 10 possible responses to a users question, then ask the user if they want to ask another question.
The recieve input must be a lowercase y or lowercase n, otherwise the program will stay at this stage continuously.
Typing y will run the program again. 
Typing n will print a goodbye message and quit the program.
